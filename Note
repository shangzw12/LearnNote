Python Note
1. CSV file operation
	with open(filename, option) as csvFile:
	myReader = csv.reader(csvFile)
	for row in myReader:
		#do sth
In this, csvFile is a alliance which could be anything; when reach for loop, row contains sth corresponding to a line of file
@ don't need to close anything

2. Matrix
Simple Operation: + - * not /
	from numpy import matrix #used for matrix operation
	from numpy import linalg #used for linear equation
	A = matrix([[1],[2],[3]]) #this is vertical vector
	B = matrix([[1,2,3]])	#this is Horizontal vector
	A.T	# transport of A is also a matrix
	C = [[1]]
	C.I	# inverse of C
	
	try to solve linear equation
	Ax = B	# A B are both matrix
	linalg.solve(A,B)	# will return x in matrix format

3. range
	for loop almost need range operation
	range(k) # will return an iterator from 0 to k-1
	range(10)	#return 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

4. format print and sys
	print "This is from {}, to {}".format(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])

5. read parameter from terminal
	sys.argv[0] 	#return program's name
	sys.argv[1]		#first para for program
	sys.argv[2]		# second para for program

6. append and extend
	A = [1,2,3]
	B = [4,5]
	A.append(B) #then A= [1,2,3,[4,5]]
	A.extend(B) #then A= [1,2,3,4,5]

7. length of list
	A = [1,2,3,4] #its length is 4
	A = [[1],[2,3,4]]	#its length is 2 not 4
